# Droppe X-max web application created by Mingyum Kim

## Introduction

A web application for approving children's wish lists for Christmas presents. You, as a parent, can check and interact with your children's wish lists and make approvals as you wish.

## Technologies

- React
- Typescript
- SCSS
- fakestoreapi.com

## How to use?

The application is very simple. Add and remove products in the wish lists and then make the final approval. Try it here: https://hardcore-swirles-81325b.netlify.app/

## How does it work?

This application uses data from fakestoreapi.com. This application creates an internal state, which is manipulated according to the user's input. When the user makes the final decision, both discarded and selected items will be pushed to the api, however **the actual data is not saved in the fakestoreapi.com database.**

## If I had more time I whould change...

- more lively UI design with animation effect
- better test coverage
